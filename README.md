# 4nn0y3r - A script to literally annoy people!

## Please use this at your own discretion, neither am I or anyone associated with the script responsible for what you do!

## Why was this made?
I made **4nn0y3r** to mostly practice Web Automation, but also to show how automation _could be_ used with malicious intent!

## How do I use this?
### This script currently only supports Chrome and Microsoft Edge for Windows.
##### More support shall be added soon!
It's pretty straightforward:  
1. Make sure you have `python3` installed in your system.
2. Open a command line and navigate to your directory.
3. Type `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
4. Once the libs required are installed, type `python whatsapp.py` to run the script.
5. Follow the on screen instructions.
